First you need to down load an IDE that support an Java file or install a Java environment kit on you system to run this file.

This system was only a console (terminal) based, so it means that this doesn't have an system design.

What this system does it connect to the website using an API, and return the weather of the specific location.

This is the first prototype that we made and is still under development, I didn't have a back-up for our final file and, but the classmate of mine on 11th grade had a back up file, however I have no contact with him anymore.
